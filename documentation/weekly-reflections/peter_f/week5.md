## Week 5 reflections

We are nearing the end of the project and I feel that most of the progress towards our goal was achieved in the last two weeks. Granted, I did get the code out for the server setup in the first two weeks but as we progressed I had to make constant changes. Mostly because it became clear after watching the MERN video that the code was poorly structured so it would have been nice to have access to that video at the beginning of the project.

We have had some difficulties with merges, but I guess that is to be expected when the repository gets bigger and the number of branches increases. I have mostly had no issues because I have kept my master fork up to date and regularly made commits and merged my branches before making pull requests.

There has been very little communication from two people in the group during the last week and instead of chasing them I have chosen to focus on working on the project with the people who manage to regularly communicate and together focus on getting a functioning and viable product.
