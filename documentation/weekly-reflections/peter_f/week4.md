## Week 4 reflections

We have made good progress this week. I think that the others in the group could pick up from the meeting that we had fallen behind. I think it also helped that Gustav was done with his work as a teacher on the Frontend course and could focus on the project more.

I think it is clear that we, or at least I, went into this project with an unclear idea of what the scrum master role entails. Instead of leading the scrum and facilitating progress reviews during meetings I feel I have become more of a manager and the general organiser of the meetings. Because there is always someone who is not at the meeting and often the same people don't show up to several meetings I have tried to do my best to write summaries and keep the whole group up to date.

It is becoming more difficult to assign tasks as well because of the lack of communication from some group members.
